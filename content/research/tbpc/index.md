title: "Moiré Photonics"
summary: "Moiré photonics is a field that leverages the optical phenomenon known as the moiré effect, which occurs when two periodic patterns are overlaid on top of each other, creating a new pattern with a larger periodicity. In our research, we are pioneering the study of twisted bilayer photonic crystals (TBPCs), focusing on the intriguing phenomena that emerge from their structural configuration. Our work encompasses the development of a theoretical model to decipher the coupling mechanisms within TBPCs, leading to the discovery of photonic flat bands and the generation of optical vortices."
