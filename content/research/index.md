      title: Temperature-adaptive radiative coolings
      text: Temperature-adaptive radiative cooling is an innovative technology that addresses the challenge of overcooling associated with daytime radiative coolers. This technology utilizes materials with thermal emissivity that adapts to temperature changes, automatically switching between a radiative cooling mode and a heat retaining mode. The adaptive response is designed to efficiently manage the temperature of surfaces—such as building roofs—by radiating excess heat into the atmosphere or space during hot conditions, while reducing heat loss during colder periods to maintain thermal comfort and energy efficiency.

      title: Moiré photonics
      text: Moiré photonics is a field that leverages the optical phenomenon known as the moiré effect, which occurs when two periodic patterns are overlaid on top of each other, creating a new pattern with a larger periodicity. In our research, we are pioneering the study of twisted bilayer photonic crystals (TBPCs), focusing on the intriguing phenomena that emerge from their structural configuration. Our work encompasses the development of a theoretical model to decipher the coupling mechanisms within TBPCs, leading to the discovery of photonic flat bands and the generation of optical vortices.

      title: Zero-power smart MEMS sensors
      text: Zero-power smart MEMS sensors refer to a category of microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) sensors that are designed to operate without the need for external power sources. By integrating new functional materials into conventional MEMS devices, we develop smart MEMS for versatile smart city applications. We work on the design, modelling, fabrication, and characterization of MEMS.
