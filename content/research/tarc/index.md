title: "Temperature-adaptive Radiative Cooling"
summary: "Temperature-adaptive radiative cooling is an innovative technology that addresses the challenge of overcooling associated with daytime radiative coolers. This technology utilizes materials with thermal emissivity that adapts to temperature changes, automatically switching between a radiative cooling mode and a heat retaining mode. The adaptive response is designed to efficiently manage the temperature of surfaces—such as building roofs—by radiating excess heat into the atmosphere or space during hot conditions, while reducing heat loss during colder periods to maintain thermal comfort and energy efficiency."
